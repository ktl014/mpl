# Random Forest Classifier
In the continuation of my research, we wanted to explore how the convolutional neural networks compared against traditional machine learning algorithms, so we chose Random Forest classification.
This is currently a work in progress, but nonetheless I wanted to share it in hopes of feedback and suggestions.

# Things to check out
The jupyter notebook current holds most of my recent progress with this, so definitely check this out. As for the feature extractor script, most of the credit goes to my colleague, as I just made minor changes to work for my datasets.
